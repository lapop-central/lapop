\title{Extract Notes from AmericasBarometer Attributes}
\usage{
lpr_extract_notes(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataset (data frame) containing notes in its attributes. The notes should
be stored as a list where each element is a vector of length 3 containing:
(1) variable name, (2) note ID, and (3) note text.}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns:
\describe{
  \item{variable_name}{Name of the variable the note belongs to}
  \item{note_id}{Identifier for the note}
  \item{note_value}{The actual note text}
}
}
\description{
Extracts notes stored in a dataset's attributes and organizes them into a tidy data frame.
This function is particularly useful for processing Stata datasets imported into R that
contain variable notes in their attributes.
}
\details{
This function processes the attributes of a dataset to extract notes that are typically
stored in a specific format. It skips any notes associated with "_dta" (dataset-level notes)
and only returns variable-specific notes. The function expects the notes to be organized
as a list where each element contains exactly three components: variable name, note ID,
and note value.
}

# Extract the notes

notes <- lpr_extract_notes(df)

\arguments{
\item{data}{Data Frame. Dataset to be used for analysis.  The data frame should have columns
titled varlabel (values of secondary variable which will be used to make each line; character),
wave (survey wave/year; character), prop (outcome variable; numeric),
proplabel (text of outcome variable; character). Default: None (must be supplied).}

\item{varlabel, wave_var, outcome_var, label_var, point_var}{Character,
character, numeric, character, numeric. Each component of the data to be plotted
can be manually specified in case the default columns in the data frame should
not be used (if, for example, the values for a given variable were altered
and stored in a new column).}

\item{ymin, ymax}{Numeric.  Minimum and maximum values for y-axis. Default: 0, 100.}

\item{main_title}{Character.  Title of graph.  Default: None.}

\item{source_info}{Character.  Information on dataset used (country, years, version, etc.),
which is added to the end of "Source: " in the bottom-left corner of the graph.
Default: None (only "Source: " will be printed).}

\item{subtitle}{Character.  Describes the values/data shown in the graph, e.g., "Percent of Mexicans who agree...".
Default: None.}

\item{lang}{Character.  Changes default subtitle text and source info to either Spanish or English.
Will not translate input text, such as main title or variable labels.  #' Takes either "en" (English)
or "es" (Spanish).  Default: "en".}

\item{legend_h_just, legend_v_just}{Numeric.  Changes location of legend. From 0 to 100.
(secondary variable labels).  Defaults: 40, -20.}

\item{subtitle_h_just}{Numeric.  Moves subtitle left to right.  From 0 to 1.
(secondary variable labels).  Defaults: 0 (left justify).}

\item{color_scheme}{Character.  Color of lines and dots.  Takes hex number, beginning with "#".
Must specify four values, even if four are not used.
Default: c("#784885", "#00adaa", "#c74e49", "#2d708e", "#a43d6a", "#202020").}

\item{percentages}{Logical.  Is the outcome variable a percentage?  Set to FALSE if you are using
means of the raw values, so that the y-axis adjusts accordingly. Default: TRUE.}

\item{all_labels}{Logical.  If TRUE, show text above all points, instead of only those in the most recent wave. Default: FALSE.}

\description{
This function creates a time series graph utilizing multiple lines representing values of
an outcome variable for different values of a secondary variable -- for example, support for
democracy over time by country.  This function is designed to be used for
AmericasBarometer data.  The maximum number of lines is four.  Unlike the lapop_ts()
single-line time series graph, this function will not print confidence lines nor will
it show text values for each year (just the final/most recent year).

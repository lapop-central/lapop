lpr_hist(
  data,
  outcome,
  filesave = "",
  cfmt = "",
  sort = "xv",
  order = "lo-hi",
  keep_nr = FALSE
)

\arguments{
\item{data}{A survey object.  The data that should be analyzed.}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable of interest to be plotted across countries
and waves, supplied as a character string.}

\item{filesave}{Character.  Path and file name to save the dataframe as csv.}

\item{cfmt}{Changes the format of the numbers displayed above the bars.
Uses sprintf string formatting syntax. Default is whole numbers for percentages
and tenths place for means.}

\item{sort}{Character. On what value the bars are sorted.
Options are "y" (for the value of the outcome variable), "xv" (default; for
the underlying values of the x variable), "xl" (for the labels of the x variable,
i.e., alphabetical).}

\item{order}{Character.  How the bars should be sorted.  Options are "hi-lo"
or "lo-hi" (default).}

\item{keep_nr}{Logical.  If TRUE, will convert "don't know" (missing code .a)
and "no response" (missing code .b) into valid data (value = 99).
The default is to examine valid responses only.  Default: FALSE.}

\value{
Returns a data frame, with data formatted for visualization by lapop_hist

\usage{
lpr_stack(
  data,
  outcome,
  by = NULL,
  sort = "xv",
  order = "lo-hi",
  filesave = "",
  keep_nr = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data that should be analyzed. It requires a survey object
from lpr_data() function.}

\item{outcome}{Character vector. Vector of variable(s) be plotted.}

\item{by}{Character. Grouping variable.  If by is provided, function will break
down the outcome variable by distinct values of the "by" variable (instead of
showing distribution of multiple outcome variables).}

\item{sort}{Character. On what value the bars are sorted. Options are "xv"
(default; sort on the underlying values of the value labels), "xl" (on the value
labels themselves, i.e. alphabetically), or "y" (on the proportions of the
outcome variable(s)).}

\item{order}{Character. How the bars should be sorted. Options are "lo-hi"
(default) or "hi-lo".}

\item{filesave}{Character. Path and file name to save the dataframe as csv.}

\item{keep_nr}{Logical. If TRUE, will convert "don't know" (missing code .a)
and "no response" (missing code .b) into valid data (value = 99) and use them
in the denominator when calculating percentages.  The default is to examine
valid responses only.  Default: FALSE.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame, with data formatted for visualization by lapop_stack
}
\description{
This function creates dataframes which can then be input in lapop_stack() for
plotting variables categories with a stacked bar graph using LAPOP formatting.
If "by" is specified, the function shows the distribution of the outcome variable
by distinct values of a secondary variable.  If "by" is not provided, it will show
the distribution of all specified outcome variables.
